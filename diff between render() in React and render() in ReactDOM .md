Q) What is diff between render() in React and render() in ReactDOM ?


Ans) In React, there are two commonly used `render()` methods: one in React and one in ReactDOM. They serve different purposes depending on the context of rendering.

### 1. **`render()` in React (Component method)**

This `render()` method is part of a React component class. It is responsible for defining the UI structure of the component by returning JSX or React elements. This method is automatically invoked by React when the componentâ€™s state or props change, and it re-renders the component as needed.

- **Purpose**: To describe what the UI should look like based on the current state and props.
- **Used in**: React component classes (not functional components).
- **Example**:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

### 2. **`render()` in ReactDOM**

This `render()` method is part of the ReactDOM library. It is used to render React components into the DOM (browser) for web applications. It is typically called in the root of your application to mount a React component onto the HTML page.

- **Purpose**: To render a React component to the DOM.
- **Used in**: Entry point of the application to link React components with the DOM (in web apps).
- **Example**:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent name="Anubhav" />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Summary of Differences:

- **`render()` in React**: A method used within React component classes to define the structure of the component.
- **`render()` in ReactDOM**: A method used to actually render React components to the DOM in web applications, linking the virtual DOM with the real DOM.

So, while `React.render()` is about defining how the component should appear, `ReactDOM.render()` is about placing that component into the real DOM in the browser.
